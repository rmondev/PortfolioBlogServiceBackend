Title: Portfolio Website Blog Service
Body:
    I want to create a backend blog blog service for my portfolio website.
    I am going to write it in TypeScript, to help sharpen up my TypeScript skills.
    I want to host the database locally on my home network NAS. The brand is Synology Diskstation DS223j.
    The NAS has a web-accessible UI, that runs an OS called "DiskStation Manager". DiskStation Manager has a program suite for NAS management, as well as a Container Manager to create and manage Docker instances. I want to host the database for this blog service using a Docker container on my NAS. The container will be created using a PostgresSQL image provided by the Container Manager. Since I don't want direct connections from the internet to my home NAS, I will route backend calls to the NAS hosted database via Cloudflare. 

    For the backend service, I will be using the Node.js runtime and the Express.js framework to run API calls for the blog (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

    The blog posts will be held in a table called "Posts". Attributes for each Post will be:

        - ID (PK, auto-generated)
        - DATE(Date)
        - CATEGORY(String)
        - TITLE(sting)
        - BODY

    Before I get to ahead of myself, I'll need to set up the environment and figure out how host my PostgresSQL service locally on my NAS.
